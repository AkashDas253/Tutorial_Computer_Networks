## Networking Model – Cheatsheet  

### **Key Concepts to Remember**  
- A **networking model** defines how different layers of a network communicate and interact with each other.  
- The **OSI** and **TCP/IP** models are the two most widely used networking models.  

### **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)**  
A conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers.  

| **Layer** | **Description** | **Protocols/Technologies** |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **7. Application** | End-user application layer, providing network services to applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS) | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, DNS |
| **6. Presentation** | Data formatting, encryption, compression, and translation. | SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII |
| **5. Session** | Manages sessions between applications. Controls dialogue between two devices (e.g., start, pause, stop). | NetBIOS, RPC |
| **4. Transport** | End-to-end communication and flow control. Ensures reliable data transfer. | TCP, UDP, SCTP |
| **3. Network** | Routing, logical addressing, and packet forwarding. Responsible for directing data from source to destination. | IP, ICMP, ARP, OSPF, BGP |
| **2. Data Link** | Provides error detection and correction, and manages MAC addressing. | Ethernet, PPP, HDLC, Wi-Fi |
| **1. Physical** | Transmits raw bitstream over physical medium (e.g., cables, radio waves). | Ethernet cables, optical fibers, Wi-Fi |

### **TCP/IP Model (Internet Protocol Suite)**  
A more simplified and practical networking model with four layers, widely used for internet communication.  

| **Layer** | **Description** | **Protocols/Technologies** |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **4. Application** | Supports application protocols and communication between software applications. | HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP |
| **3. Transport** | Provides communication between processes (end-to-end communication). Ensures reliable data transfer. | TCP, UDP |
| **2. Internet** | Defines logical addressing and routing (equivalent to OSI Network layer). | IP, ICMP, ARP |
| **1. Link** | Deals with data transmission over physical links (combines OSI's Data Link and Physical layers). | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP |

### **Differences Between OSI and TCP/IP Models**  

| **Aspect** | **OSI Model** | **TCP/IP Model** |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Layers** | 7 layers (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical) | 4 layers (Application, Transport, Internet, Link) |
| **Focus** | Conceptual, standardization model | Practical, real-world implementation |
| **Usage** | Used for teaching, understanding protocols | Used in internet communication, based on the IP suite |

### **Key Protocols to Remember**  
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Web communication (Application Layer).  
- **FTP**: File transfer (Application Layer).  
- **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented communication (Transport Layer).  
- **UDP**: Unreliable, connectionless communication (Transport Layer).  
- **IP**: Routing and logical addressing (Network Layer).  
- **MAC Addressing**: Unique address for devices on the local network (Data Link Layer).  

### **Important Concepts**  
- **Encapsulation**: Data from the higher layers is encapsulated into packets or frames as it moves down the layers.  
- **De-encapsulation**: Data is unpacked as it moves up the layers from the physical medium to the application.  
- **Addressing**: Logical (IP) and physical (MAC) addressing used in the respective layers.  
- **Routing vs Switching**: Routing occurs at the Network Layer, and switching at the Data Link Layer.

## **Properties of Network Models**

Network models are essential frameworks that define how data is transmitted and processed across networks. These models help standardize the processes involved in communication, making it easier to troubleshoot, implement, and design networks.

The two most widely used network models are the **OSI Model** and the **TCP/IP Model**. Both models share common properties and principles but differ in their structure and number of layers.

#### **1. Layered Structure**
One of the fundamental properties of network models is their **layered architecture**. Each layer of a network model performs specific functions and communicates with the layers directly above and below it. The layering system simplifies network design, making it modular and easier to manage.

- **Benefits**:
  - **Modularity**: Each layer can be independently developed and improved.
  - **Isolation of Functions**: Problems are easier to isolate because each layer handles a distinct aspect of communication.
  - **Interoperability**: Different technologies and protocols can interact within a defined layer, ensuring compatibility.

#### **2. Abstraction**
Network models provide **abstraction** by hiding the complexity of lower layers from the higher layers. Each layer only needs to understand its direct interaction with the layers above and below it, without needing to know how these functions are performed.

- **Example**: The **Application Layer** in the OSI and TCP/IP models abstracts lower-level concerns such as data transmission and routing, focusing instead on tasks like user interfaces and communication protocols (HTTP, FTP, etc.).

#### **3. Standardization**
Both the **OSI Model** and **TCP/IP Model** offer standardized protocols and functions at each layer, which helps in creating universal guidelines for network communication. These standards ensure consistency in communication across different devices and platforms.

- **Example**: The **Network Layer** in both models ensures devices can communicate using standardized IP addresses.

#### **4. Data Encapsulation and Decapsulation**
In network models, data undergoes **encapsulation** at the sender's side and **decapsulation** at the receiver's side. Each layer adds a header (or sometimes footer) to the data, providing necessary control and addressing information for the respective layer.

- **Encapsulation Process**:
  1. Data is generated at the **Application Layer**.
  2. The data is passed down, with each layer adding its own header (or other control information).
  3. The final form of the data is transmitted over the physical medium.
  
- **Decapsulation Process**:
  1. Upon arrival, each layer strips away the respective headers as the data moves up to the receiving device.
  2. At the **Application Layer**, the data is presented in a usable format for the end-user application.

#### **5. Protocol Independence**
Network models offer **protocol independence**, meaning that different protocols can operate within the same layer. This flexibility allows the use of various protocols to perform the same function, depending on the application or requirements.

- **Example**: At the **Transport Layer**, both **TCP** and **UDP** can be used, depending on whether a reliable or unreliable connection is needed.

#### **6. Fault Isolation and Troubleshooting**
One of the key properties of network models is **fault isolation**. By dividing network communication into layers, it becomes easier to identify and resolve issues. If an issue occurs at a specific layer, it can be isolated and dealt with without affecting other parts of the network.

- **Example**: If an issue arises at the **Application Layer**, it is less likely to be caused by a problem in the **Network Layer** (IP routing or addressing).

#### **7. Protocol Hierarchy**
Network models define a **protocol hierarchy** where each layer has specific protocols that define how it communicates and performs its functions. These protocols are organized to ensure the correct flow of data across the network.

- **Example**:
  - **OSI Model**: In the **Transport Layer**, protocols like **TCP** and **UDP** determine how data is managed for reliable or best-effort communication.
  - **TCP/IP Model**: Similar, but the protocols are implemented in the Internet Layer (for routing) and Transport Layer (for connection management).

#### **8. Scalability**
A network model’s structure is designed to accommodate **scalability**, meaning it can grow and adapt as network size or complexity increases. As new technologies emerge, network models can be extended or adapted to include new layers or protocols.

- **Example**: The **Application Layer** can evolve to include new protocols (like **HTTP/2** or **QUIC**) without disrupting the operation of lower layers in the OSI or TCP/IP models.

#### **9. Security**
Security is a key property in modern network models, with each layer implementing specific security measures to protect data. Some layers handle encryption, authentication, and integrity checks to ensure that data is protected as it moves through the network.

- **Example**:
  - **Transport Layer**: **SSL/TLS** protocols provide encryption and secure data transmission.
  - **Application Layer**: Security protocols like **HTTPS** ensure secure communication between web browsers and servers.

#### **10. Flexibility and Compatibility**
Network models provide a flexible and compatible framework for designing networks. As network technologies advance, models like OSI and TCP/IP allow for the integration of newer protocols and devices without completely redesigning the network architecture.

- **Example**: **IPv4** and **IPv6** protocols can operate at the **Network Layer** without requiring changes to other layers in the TCP/IP model.

### **Conclusion**
Network models are essential in understanding how networks operate, ensuring efficient communication, troubleshooting, and adaptability across different types of networks. The **OSI Model** and **TCP/IP Model** both provide structure, abstraction, and standardization, allowing networks to grow and integrate new technologies over time. Understanding the properties of network models ensures efficient design, operation, and management of modern network infrastructures.
